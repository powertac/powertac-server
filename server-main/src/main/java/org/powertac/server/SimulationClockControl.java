/**
 * Timer-based clock management for the Power TAC simulator. This is a
 * singleton class, but it must be initialized with a reference to the 
 * timeService in order to do its job. Therefore, it is an error to 
 * attempt to retrieve the instance before initialization.
 * <p>
 * The basic design for this scheme is given at 
 * https://github.com/powertac/powertac-server/wiki/Time-management.
 * The goal is to produce a tick by calling timeService.updateTime() 
 * every n seconds, where n is 3600/timeService.rate. So if 
 * timeService.rate is 360, this would be a tick every 10 seconds.
 * Current simulation time is given by the formula
 *   time = rate * (systemTime - start) + base
 * where start, base, and rate are simulation parameters.</p>
 * <p>
 * We assume that the simulator is a single thread, although it may
 * control other threads. That thread waits for the next tick, then
 * does some work. Ideally, that work will be completed in fewer than
 * n seconds, but occasionally it may take longer. Since the broker 
 * needs to keep track of time on its own, it needs to know when this
 * happens, and must be informed of the updated start time so that it
 * can compute a simulation time that agrees with the server. In
 * addition, a broker might want to pause the clock in order to allow
 * a user to fill out a dialog or otherwise interact with a user. Given
 * an appropriate set of messages, this event could be handled in much
 * the same way as a server timeslot overrun.</p>
